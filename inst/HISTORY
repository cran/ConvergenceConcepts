Version 0.5 : First released version submitted to CRAN.

2009-02-01
----------

Version 0.6 : 
- The label $\hat{l}_n(t)$ has been replaced by $\hat{l}_n(t)=|\hat{F}_n(t)-F(t)|$. This has also been added in the documentation for \verb#check.convergence#.
- The \verb#trace# argument has been changed into the \verb#plotfunc# argument which should hopefully be a more meaningfull name. It can be used to choose the type of function used to draw the plot (for example \verb#plot# or \verb#points#). It is mainly a technical argument required because a second call to the \verb#plot# function replaces the previous plot. So, for example, if you want to draw two curves on the same plot, you should first use the \verb#plot# function then second use the \verb#points# function (with type="l"). This is for example used in Example 2 where we want to draw 3 curves on the same plot (see R code source inside investigate.R file). But maybe there is a clever way to code this? The description of this argument in help files is now : R function used to draw the plot: for example \verb#plot# or \verb#points#.
- I replaced the p="" argument of the plot.ecdf function (inside law.plot2d function) with do.points=FALSE since the former is now obsolete in newer R versions.
- I replaced everywhere lwd=0.01 with lwd=1 since it does not give good results in newer R versions.

Version 0.7 :
- I updated the CITATION file to suppress WARNING on CRAN

2009-12-22
----------

Version 0.8 :
- I added checks for of platform type (unix, windows,mac) to launch the proper window device (X11, windows or quartz) in function investigate()
- I modified the text for Example 3 where there were a mistake: we want to check convergence in law to a N(0,1) distribution and not towards 0.
- I modified the law-plot2d.R file where I permuted the plot.ecd() and curve() functions, and remove par(new=TRUE)

Version 0.9 :
- I modified a mistake for the checks for of platform type (unix, windows,mac) to launch the proper window device (X11, windows or quartz) in function investigate()

2010-02-10
----------

Version 1.0 :
- I removed a line in the file investigate.R because a line should not appear in the subject of exercice 4.

2014-10-10
----------

Version 1.1:
- I added a NAMESPACE file
- I changed critp to critas in function plotright() in file p-as-plot.R to correct a bug in the display (right panel)
- I used the dev.new() function in the investigate.R file (instead of the obsoletes X11(), quartz() and windows() ones)
- I added tcltk in Depends field of DESCRIPTION file and in import of NAMESPACE file
- I used environments in the investigate.R file to remove NOTEs appearing when R CMD check our package
